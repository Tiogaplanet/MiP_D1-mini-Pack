Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! This is a small project maintained by yours truly and it is meant make programming and connecting MiP to the Internet easy and fun. I'm a hobbiest and my day job is distinctly outside tech spheres so what I've done here is certainly not professional grade. Contributions that refine and improve the board are highly encouraged. Equally important are contributions that document this project. If you can improve this board or the documention or if you've identified a problem and have a fix, please send a pull request.
