# MiP_D1-mini-Pack
A [D1 mini](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini) adapter board for [WowWee Labs'](https://github.com/WowWeeLabs/) [MiP](https://wowwee.com/mip) robot.  Similar to the [MiP ProMini Pack](https://github.com/adamgreen/MiP_ProMini-Pack), this board adapts the D1 mini and compatible boards to MiP.  Either install the D1 mini Pack in a pair of pin headers or solder it directly to the board and you'll be programming MiP to connect to the Internet in no time.

## Acknowledgment
* As always, a big "thank you" goes out to [adamgreen](https://github.com/adamgreen/).  Without his help I'd still be wondering why my MiP won't talk to an Arduino.  Now, it's talking to the Internet!
* I'd also like to thank [Casey Kuhns](https://github.com/caseykuhns) who while at [SparkFun](https://github.com/sparkfun) developed the original [ProMini Pack](https://github.com/sparkfun/mip_promini-pack) and the [ProtoPack](https://github.com/sparkfun/mip_proto-pack) which provided the foundation for this project.
